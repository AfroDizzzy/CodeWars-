/*
Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

arrayDiff([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

arrayDiff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

*/



//solution
//This function takes in two arrays. The filter function sorts through an array based on a input test function. The test function here takes each element of a (x) and checks if this element is in b. 
//By negating the b.includes(x) function we remove all the elements that a and b share, and only include those elements from b that are unique to b. 

function arrayDiff(a, b) {
  return a.filter( x => !b.includes(x));
}
