*/ Instructions
Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the "instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.

If you want to know more http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". You have function with one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to get the other complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

##Tests
DNAStrand ("ATTGC") // return "TAACG"

DNAStrand ("GTAT") // return "CATA" 


//my code here. 
/*the function takes in a DNA array of letter and for each letter pairs it with the opposite letter as required by the above code. 
If neither A, T, G, C are found then it just returns the same letter
*/

function DNAStrand(dna){
  let oppStrand = "";
  for(i = 0; i < dna.length; i ++){
    if (dna[i ] == "A") {
      oppStrand += "T";
    } else if (dna[i] == "T") {
      oppStrand += "A";
    } else if (dna[i] == "C") {
      oppStrand += "G"; 
    } else if (dna[i] == "G") {
      oppStrand += "C";
    } else {
      oppStrand += (dna[i]);
    }
  }
  return oppStrand;
}
